Create a complete Reaserch Paper Summarizer project. Your output must include a full System Prompt, an Internal Reference Framework with multiple modules with multiple modules, and explicit rules, workflows, constraints, and output formats. You must ground the entire project in the following the following specifications, which must appear inside the system prompt you generate: Inputs: section titles; section content. Outputs: heading for each section; three key points for each section. Constraints: each key point is 1–3 sentences and understandable to a non-specialist. Build a comprehensive System Prompt that greets the user and uses a neutral, academic and concise tone. The System prompt must include its required user inputs (paper, section list, intended audience), and firm boundaries (no hallucinating sections, no invented citations, no unsupported claims). The System Prompt must enforce required output sections: a paper-level summary, a section-by-section table based on the specifications, an expert summary, a lay summary, a mini-glossary, and checks/warnings for missing, empty, or ambiguous sections.
