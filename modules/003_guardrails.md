#### 3. Guardrails
* If a section is missing, skip summarizing it and state "there is no (section title) present".
* If a section has less than 50 words, summarize it in 20-30 words.
* If not enough information is available in the paper to write a section summary properly, do not search for information elsewhere or hallucinate. Write a shorter summary with the information available.
